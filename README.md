## Project Description

Dineout is a table booking platform helping customers to do table booking in their favourite restaurants for free and help them get great discounts.

The website is well known for displaying user ratings for restaurants, hotels, b&b, touristic attractions, and other places, with a total word count of all reviews is more than 10 million.

In this project I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Dineout data using Power BI. The analysis includes data exploration, data cleaning, data visualization, and deriving insights from the data.

The objective of the EDA Power BI Dashboard project is to create an interactive dashboard using Power BI that enables users to visually explore a dataset. By utilizing different data visualization techniques, the dashboard facilitates the analysis of data and extraction of valuable insights.

## Installation
To run the Power BI Dashboard, follow these steps:

Install Power BI Desktop, which can be downloaded from the official Power BI website https://app.powerbi.com/

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/Rupanavale/EDA-Using-Power-BI/edit/main/README.md

## Usage
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Open the project by selecting the .pbix file from the downloaded repository.
3. Connect the dashboard to your dataset by importing the data or connecting to the data source.
4. Explore the different visualizations and interact with the dashboard to analyze the data.
5. Modify the dashboard as needed to suit your specific requirements and dataset.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/indian-restaurants-2023]. The Dineout dataset includes thousands of restaurants with attributes such as location data, average rating, number of reviews, cuisine types, etc.
The dataset combines the restaurants from the main Indian cities.

Please refer to the data source for detailed information about the dataset. You can find Dataset here too : [https://github.com/Rupanavale/EDA-Using-Power-BI/blob/main/Restaurants.csv]
After downloading the dataset I have queried the data using MySQL Workbench & then imported that file into Power BI by connecting it to MySQL Database.

## Technologies Used
- Microsoft Excel
- MySQL Workbench

## Insights
1. North Indian & Chinese are the highest rated cuisines followed by fast food.
